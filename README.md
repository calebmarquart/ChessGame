# macOS Chess Game

This is a chess games build for macOS using the native SwiftUI framework for macOS. The app uses many different algorithmns to determine chess moves and allows for a fully functional game including all of the special moves (en passant, castling, etc.).

The game is two-player only at the moment. There are no additional features such as playing versus computer with AI, but they could be added in the future.

The purpose of this game is to showcase competence in using Swift and SwiftUI to builid a working and useful application. Fundamental programming concepts and algorithmns are also found throughout the code so have a peak!
